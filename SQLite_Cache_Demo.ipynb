        "Welcome to the PromptMule CacheCast series of Generative AI Cache Demos! This collection of demos is designed to explore various cache techniques for Generative AI models, enabling faster and more efficient inference on large language models. In Part 2, we delve into the realm of \"SQLite Cache,\" where we'll showcase how caching data in SQLite can significantly improve the performance of Generative AI-based apps. By employing smart caching strategies, we aim to reduce response times, optimize resource utilization, and create a seamless user experience when interacting with language models. Join us on this exciting journey as we uncover the power of caching in the world of Generative AI!"

        "# SQLite Cache Benchmarking Demo\n",
        "\n",
        "This repository contains a Python script for benchmarking the performance of a cache using a sample function (`llm_langchain`) as a test prompt. The script is designed to be executed on Google Colab notebooks.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "The Cache Benchmarking Demo is a Python script that measures the execution time of a cache for a specific function (`llm_langchain`) that processes a given text. In this version, we explore the use of an SQLite database as the caching mechanism. The script is designed to show the time difference between the first execution (bypassing the cache) and subsequent cache hits using SQLite.\n",
        "\n",
        "The demo utilizes the `timeit` module to calculate the execution time for each iteration. It provides valuable insights into how caching with SQLite can improve the performance of repetitive operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note:** Before running the demo, ensure you have an OpenAI API key. Replace `YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY` in the script with your actual API key.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Usage on Google Colab\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Open Google Colab in your web browser: [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. In Google Colab, click on \"File\" > \"New Notebook\" to create a new notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. In the code cell, paste the following to clone the repository and run the benchmarking demo:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "!git clone https://github.com/promptmule4real/demo/blob/main/SQLite_Cache_Demo.ipynb\n",
        "%cd cache-benchmark-demo\n",
        "!pip install openai  # Install OpenAI library\n",
        "!pip install sqlite3  # Install SQLite library\n",
        "!python benchmark.py --api_key=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Replace `your_username` with your actual GitHub username and `YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY` with your OpenAI API key.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Click on the \"Run\" button to execute the code. The benchmarking demo will run, and you will see the output showing the execution times.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Functionality\n",
        "\n",
        "### `llm_langchain(text)`\n",
        "\n",
        "The `llm_langchain` function represents a sample prompt processing function. It should be implemented to perform some meaningful processing on the given text and return the result. In this demo, we have implemented a placeholder function that simply returns the input text. Replace this function with your actual prompt processing logic for accurate benchmarking.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Benchmarking\n",
        "\n",
        "The script performs the following steps for benchmarking the cache:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. First Execution (Bypassing Cache):\n",
        "   The script runs the `llm_langchain` function once to measure the time it takes for the first execution without utilizing the cache. This time represents the execution time without cache hits.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Cache Hits (Subsequent Executions):\n",
        "   After the first execution, the script runs the `llm_langchain` function multiple times (`num_iterations`) to simulate cache hits using SQLite as the caching mechanism. The time taken for each execution is measured, and the average execution time is calculated for cache hits.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Contributing\n",
        "\n",
