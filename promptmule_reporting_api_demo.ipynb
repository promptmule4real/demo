These will be kept in the AWS Cloud until you wish to download them via a the Report API. First, you will need to generate some traffic with a few prompts, then some reports.\n",

        "This tutorial will guide you through the process of using the Reporting API, enabling you to harness the full potential of the PromptMule reporting service. Tailored specifically for a Google Colaboratory runtime environment, this demo provides an engaging exploration into sending reports through OpenAI and testing reporting functions. If you do not have an API-KEY or Token, see the Github guide to generate those here:[https://github.com/promptmule4real/demo/blob/main/promptmule_api_demo.ipynb]\n",
