# OpenAI + PromptMule Cache Functional Demo v0.3

## Overview

Welcome to the interactive demonstration guide for OpenAI and PromptMule Cache Functional Demo v0.3. This guide will navigate you through the process of generating an API Key and Token, which will unlock the ability to utilize the PromptMule cloud cache. This demo is designed specifically for the Google Colaboratory runtime environment and offers a hands-on experience with sending prompts through OpenAI and testing cache functions.

## Getting Started

1. To start, click the "Open in Colab" icon situated at the top left corner of the page: https://github.com/promptmule4real/demo/blob/main/promptmule_api_demo.ipynb. This will launch the Google Colab notebook in a new tab of your web browser, where you can run, modify, and interact with this demo in a safe, non-intrusive enviornment. You can save the changes you make so you can come back later and pick up where you left off.

2. Once the notebook is open in Google Colab, follow the subsequent step-by-step instructions to create your PromptMule API Key and Token.
